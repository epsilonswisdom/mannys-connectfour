[Play my game(https://mannysconnectfour.netlify.app/)]

# Manny’s Connect 4

A classic board game played for ages 4 & up.
Objective: Each player takes turns choosing a space to occupy with their tiles. In order to win the player must have 4 tiles in a row either diagonally, vertically, or horizontally. If either player completes the winning condition the game will end.  
I chose this project or game specifically because of my childhood. In the Fourth grade, I was not athletic nor social (Autism). So, during our breaks my teacher at the time Ms. Wilson was kind enough to spend her time with me. We would either play Chess or Connect4. I would say I would lose 60% of the time, it did not matter because it was all for fun. It taught me how to recognize patterns, read my opponent’s next move or think critically. Simple games sometimes inspire or help develop our cognitive skills.
