// 1)Define the needed variables to keep track of the state of the game.
// 1a)variables that should be defined
// cnt4board
// winner
//loser maybe not cause if you have two truthys you can make loser a falsy
// tie


// 2)Store the cached elements 
// name constants I wanna make them circles so circEls youre gonna need to store 7x6 so it would be 42 circles
// we want messages to appear so make a msg element.
// set up click and btns and event listeners as well but after our base script is set up 
// 


//3) try loading the game, see if its rendering. User should be able to view it Don't forget to add some css so youre not looking at a white board.
//a)Create the needed functions to render the board. so you need to store an array for the 42 elements

//b)create a render function to see if the board is rendered above is repeated but more research is req.


// c)css imagine the board make it a grid of (Length by Width) 7 x 6 thats how many playable spaces should be




//4)Render the board console.log to make sure once that happens you can start using functions to add using the variables

//a)you need functions for a tie, taking turns, a winner, a loser, a random math generator so adding a computer too for single players.

//b) you wanna make functions for the changing state of the game.
// write out winning combos. Diagnally and linear connecting four in a row  I think maybe more than 8 ways to win?

// c) add evt listeners for handling actions like player click then write functions for input by the user.

// d)you also want to check for chip placements check for winner, tie and loser, as well player turns

// e)if game works make a reset button
//5 Make it pretty for Ben not confetti maybe stars going everywhere
